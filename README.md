# Echoes: Preserving Generational Wisdom

Echoes is a digital platform that preserves and celebrates generational wisdom by connecting people through shared stories, guided conversations, and meaningful reflections across age divides.

## 🌟 Overview

Echoes addresses the growing generational disconnect in our society by creating a space where knowledge, experiences, and insights can flow freely between different age groups. Our platform serves as both an archive of wisdom and a vibrant community where meaningful intergenerational dialogue flourishes.

## ✨ Key Features

### Story Archive
Users can submit stories from or about older generations in various formats (text, audio, images). Whether it's a grandmother's journey as an immigrant, a grandfather's untold war experiences, or quiet wisdom from a beloved elder, these stories find a home on Echoes.

### Thematic Collections
Stories are organized into browsable collections that make wisdom accessible and relevant:

### Community Circles
Inspired by "We're Not Really Strangers," Echoes creates intimate discussion groups where members connect through guided conversations about life, loss, love, and legacy.

### Intergenerational Prompts
Weekly questions prompt both younger and older users to reflect on universal human experiences, building bridges across generational divides.
